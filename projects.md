Welcome to my showroom! Here are my proudest projects and activities I have had honor to be a part of.

## Activities

- **[Free Contest:](https://sites.google.com/site/kc97blf/)** A weekly contest for all Vietnamese students that helps them practice their skills in coding, problem solving, designing algorithms. I used to be proposer of the team, but now I mainly work as a system administrator and a communicator.

- **[Project in Mathematics and Applications:](http://pimavn.com)** A mission to inspire the young to study Mathematics by their tremendously useful applications to daily life and urgent issues the world is facing.

## Projects

- **AlgoTrading:** A forex trading system written in Python that gives predictions on future exchange rates and automatically selects a strategy to make profitable decisions. I take care of its Cassandra database and software architecture.

- **[FOSSASIA GCi 2016 Website:](http://gci16.fossasia.org)** A well-designed website that archived students' participation in Google Code-in 2016 in partner with FOSSASIA. I am the maintainer of this project.

- **[Susi the Twitter Bot:](https://github.com/fossasia/susi_tweetbot)** A small project as a part of integrating Susi, whose back end was maintained by FOSSASIA, to social media platforms. This is still a remarkable project to me in attempt to use API to program my first applications.

## Blogs

I plan to write **a lot of** tutorials and personaly posts for this site. This section will be updated later, stay tuned!
