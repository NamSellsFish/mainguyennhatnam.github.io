            I would like to express my sincere gratitude and appreciation to these wonderful people for supporting and helping me get through difficult chapters of life.

                <td class="gh-contrib">Needless to say, she was the most influential person in my life. I cannot have what I have today without her nurturing and educating me. She also listened and supported my decisions many times despite they were unconventional. No matter how old I am and how much in life I have experienced, she can still surprise me with her great sagacity and intelligence.</td>

                <td class="gh-contrib">He was my good friend when I was young. He bought me toys and took the family to travel here and there. He worked hard to pay my expensive university tuition and I am forever grateful for that.</td>

                <td class="gh-contrib">Many friends of my age have lots of potentials and they are indeed more successful than me. It's disappointing when you know you're left behind in a race. It was a good fortune to know Quynh, who advised me to focus on my own strength and pursue my goals in the hard time.

He was such a generous teacher who invited me to his class and refused the tuition fee I gave him. Had I not come to his class, I wouldn't be confident to pursue a Mathematics career. </td>

            I have been helped by many people in my life, from friends, family, to strangers that I cannot remember to list all the names here. Pardon me if I missed you and thank you for being a part of the story.
