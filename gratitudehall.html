            I would like to express my sincere gratitude and appreciation to these wonderful people for supporting and helping me get through difficult chapters of life.

                <td class="gh-contrib">Needless to say, she was the most influential person in my life. I cannot have what I have today without her nurturing and educating me. She also listened and supported my decisions many times despite they were unconventional. No matter how old I am and how much in life I have experienced, she can still surprise me with her great sagacity and intelligence.</td>

                <td class="gh-contrib">He was my good friend when I was young. He bought me toys and took the family to travel here and there. He worked hard to pay my expensive university tuition and I am forever grateful for that.</td>

                <td class="gh-contrib">Many friends of my age have lots of potentials and they are indeed more successful than me. It's disappointing when you know you're left behind in a race. It was a good fortune to know Quynh, who advised me to focus on my own strength and pursue my goals in the hard time.

                <td class="gh-contrib">  When I was a middle school boy, I didn't have money to go to have extra classes. He was such a generous teacher who invited me to his class and refused the tuition fee I gave him. Had I not come to his class, I wouldn't be confident to pursue a Mathematics career. </td>

                <td class="gh-contrib">  I met him two years ago. He was such an admirable person with an immensely kind heart. His success in the academia is a source of inspiration for me to study and endeavor. Although we sometimes fight, he's still my best friend. </td>

                <td class=gh-contrib> She helped me to shift my life from a bookworm to an active student. She encouraged me to seek for more opportunities and engage in several projects. There were fights between us and things were not as good as they used to be, but her influence in making me who I am today is undeniable. </td>

                <td class=gh-contrib> He was a passionate instructor and helped me a lot in my careers. I could not achieve this position if I had not met him. Thanks to him, I got the second prize in a contest, which significantly boosted the faith in myself. We had some unwanted conflicts, however I still appreciate his efforts in teaching me complicated concepts that perhaps cannot be explained better by anyone else. </td>

                <td class=gh-name> Tran Nguyet Anh <br><span class=gh-rela> (teacher) </span></td>
                <td class=gh-contrib> I majored in pure Mathematics when I was in secondary school not because I loved it, but rather, it was my uncle's advice. Math plays an important role in the mindset of Vietnamese people. She was the first person to teach me programming and conditioned my passion in softwares and computers. I found where I belonged to and, three years later, I changed my focus to Computer Science, against the objections from my uncle. </td>

            I have been helped by many people in my life, from friends, family, to strangers that I cannot remember to list all the names here. Pardon me if I missed you and thank you for being a part of the story.
