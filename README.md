# Thien's Personal Blog

The site used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

There are two layouts frequently used that are `page` and `post` (situated in folder `_layouts`). The two's headers are different, as described in `_includes/header.html` (header for `page`) and `_includes/header-post.html` (header for `post`).

1. The layout `page` always have a slideshow of images on the page. It is mainly used for special page like home page or about page. The images are implicitly stored in `_data/bigimg.yml`.
2. The layout `post` allows one to choose one of these options:
  - Put images, which are explicitly defined by the `big-img` field in the page;
  - Put random images generated by [Trianglify](https://github.com/qrohlf/trianglify). In this case, one does not need to define anything;
  - Have no images at all by defining a field `no-img` in the page;

To run the site locally, follow the instruction on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to install Jekyll first, then run `jekyll serve`. The site will run at `localhost:4000/`
