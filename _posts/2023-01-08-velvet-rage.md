I know it’s not speaking for everyone’s experience, but I found myself between the pages. I’m actually impressed how the author traced the typical gay personality traits down to the way gay men grew up. From the unhealed emotional trauma to the toxic behaviors, he unfolded many hurtful truths about gay men that sometimes left me stunned yet enlightened. It’s a mirror that sees my naked body.

The advice chapter was also well-prepared. I remember multiple times I wanted to counter his argument, only to be responded in the next paragraph.

Reading this book feels like a review on the lessons I learned from therapy plus the ones I’m yet to learn. I love it. I recommend this book for any gay man in his 20s.
