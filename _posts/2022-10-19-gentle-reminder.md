This is my comfort book. I wish I had read this book sooner when I broke up with my first love. I recommend this for the romanticists who find it hard to let go, who’s scared of being vulnerable, yet crave to be connected. Some things I learn from this is to always embrace your feelings and experience, see your sensibility as a gift instead of a curse, and while you can be vulnerable and wholehearted, you have to be able to walk away from people and things that are no longer in your life. The book makes me feel seen and understood. Some parts were a bit repetitive but I don’t mind, I believe it’s the point of reminding—what’s important should be brought to attention mofe often, doesn’t make the book any less boring.
