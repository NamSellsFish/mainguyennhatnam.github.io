Wew, this blog has been so quiet lately. First good news is that this blog finally has its own domain at [http://tvhoang.com](http://tvhoang.com). It's not HTTPS yet, I'm too lazy to get it HTTPS. In fact, I purchased a free server on Azure with my Microsoft student account, but you know... :/ I'm too lazy to set it up. What a mess my life is.

As I told you before, I got accepted to Google Summer of Code 2018. I work for CGAL Project this year. Man, I heard that most of scientists are very tough and unfriendly, but my mentor is really cool and wholesome. :p This package will go to a testing phase this month or next month, and will be integrated to CGAL if successful. My name stands first in the author list, hehe, and that's not alphabetically, okay? Anyway I'm very happy to be the main maintainer of the package. So far it's the brightest achievement I have made. Thank you all, my mentor, my friends, and my teachers for your support. The VP of my university granted me the permission to be absent from classes to work on this project. How cool is he, right! I have to thank him personally when the document of my package gets published! And surely I will update that on this blog too!

So, what I implemented in this package is called "Generalized Region Growing." You may have heard of [Region Growing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region_growing) before. It has a close relationship with [Breadth-First Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search). You have one initial **point**, called the seed point, you have to look at **other points around it**. If the seed point is **similar** to its neighbor, the region is "grown" a little bit. And it keeps going like that to the newly added points. There are three things to be generalized here, which I wrote them in bold face:

- Point: What can be a point? It could be a 2D point, a 3D point, a pixel on an image, or even a face in a mesh etc.
- Other points around it: How do you get these points? If a point is a pixel, its neighbors could be 8 surrounding pixels. If a point is a 2D point, its neighbors could be all points such that the distances from them to the seed point are smaller than a certain amount, etc.
- Similar: How do you know two points are similar? If point is pixel, the similarity can be the difference in colors. If the case is 3D point, the similarity can be intepreted to be the similarity between the neighbor and the enclosing region; which means we compare the neighbor to the whole region grown in order to decide if we should add this neighbor to the region.

That is how the package is generalized. I had to write the core algorithm and a flexible interface so that the user can easily provide these properties/functions and achieve the best result. I've learnt quite a lot of template metaprogramming this summer. It's the powerful tool to solve these kinds of general problem, like how the famous C++ Standard Template Library succeeded.

I'm really happy with the outcome of this program. I have been intellectually challenged and inspired by the scientists at INRIA and CGAL. I start to think that I will pursue the Computer Vision field for the rest of my life. But, who knows?, yesterday I wanted to be a cook. Things change in the blink of an eye, right?

The program is going near to the end. I've submitted all the code to CGAL. The payment and rewards will be sent soon. I suddenly realize that, although I've earned quite a deal of money, greedy me is still not satisfied. Half of the money is spent on tuition. :/ The rest of them I will use to pay for the rent and food next year, being independent from my parents as much as possible, because I'm 19 already...

I hope that next year I can learn even more. The greatest achievement of a scientist is the acquisition of knowledge, isn't it?
